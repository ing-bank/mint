Thank you for your interest and time in MINT!

## Types of contributions
We'd love your input in the project. There are various ways you can contribute:

1. Providing feedback. _Any_ feedback you might have is welcomed, as we want to grow the project and the best way to do so is by learning from you, the community. Please reach out to us by opening an issue and we can have a discussion. 

2. Bugfixes. We welcome those with open arms. Feel free to share patches or pull requests if you think something is wrong. If you are unsure about something we are also happy to discuss. 

3. Enhancements. Like with bugfixes, we are happy to discuss your potential enhancements and will work with you to get it accepted in the codebase, as long as it is in line with the vision of MINT. 

In general we applaud all efforts to improve the tooling. This is a community project and without an open and healthy culture the project will not be able to grow.
